To trigger an operation.

## When To Use

A button means an operation (or a series of operations). Clicking a button will trigger corresponding business logic.

In Settle UI Design we provide 4 variants of button.

- Primary button: indicate the main action, one primary button at most in one section.
- Secondary button: indicate the seconadry action.
- Tertiary button: indicate a series of actions without priority.
- Link button: used for external links.

And 4 other properties additionally.

- `disabled`: when actions are not available.
- `loading`: add loading spinner in button, avoiding multiple submits too.

## API

Different button styles can be generated by setting Button properties. The recommended order is: `variant` ->  `size` -> `loading` -> `disabled`.

| Property | Description | Type | Default | Version |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| disabled | Disabled state of button | boolean | false |  |
| loading | Set the loading status of button | boolean | false |  |
| size | Set the size of button | `lg` \| `xl` \| `base` \| `sm` \| `sx` | 'base' |  |
| variant | Can be set to `primary` `secondary` `tertiary` `link` | string | 'tertiary' |  |

It accepts all props which native buttons support.
